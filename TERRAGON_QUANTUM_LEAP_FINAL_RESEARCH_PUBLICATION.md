## 1. Introduction

Traditional machine learning faces a fundamental trade-off on resource-constrained devices: accuracy requires computational complexity that exceeds power budgets. Our work eliminates this constraint through four interconnected breakthrough algorithms:

1. **Adaptive Hypervector Dimensionality (AHD)** - Dynamic dimension optimization preserving conformal guarantees
2. **Quantum Superposition Encoding (QSE)** - Exponential compression via quantum-inspired superposition
3. **Neuromorphic Spiking Conformal Prediction (NSCP)** - Event-driven uncertainty quantification
4. **Hierarchical Conformal Calibration (HCC)** - Minimal-data coverage guarantees

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Adaptive Hypervector Dimensionality (AHD)

**Problem:** Fixed-dimension HDC wastes resources or sacrifices accuracy depending on task complexity.

**Breakthrough:** Dimension-invariant conformal calibration theory.

**Theorem 1 (Dimension-Invariant Coverage):** For adaptive HDC with dimension transformation $d_1 \rightarrow d_2$, conformal prediction sets maintain coverage guarantees:
$$P(Y_{n+1} \in C_\alpha(X_{n+1})) \geq 1 - \alpha - O\left(\frac{\log(\max(d_1,d_2))}{\min(d_1,d_2)}\right)$$

**Proof Sketch:** Based on Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma extension to conformal prediction with novel score transformation preserving distributional properties.

### 2.2 Quantum Superposition Encoding (QSE)

**Problem:** Standard HDC requires full-dimension storage even for sparse representations.

**Breakthrough:** Quantum-inspired superposition maintains separability with exponential compression.

**Theorem 2 (Superposition Separability):** For $k$-state superposition encoding with orthogonal basis $\{B_i\}$, classification separability is preserved:
$$\|S_c - S_{c'}\|_2 \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|\text{HDC}_c - \text{HDC}_{c'}\|_2$$

where $S_c$ is the superposition encoding of class $c$.

### 2.3 Neuromorphic Spiking Conformal Prediction (NSCP)

**Problem:** Continuous-valued conformal scores require expensive floating-point operations.

**Breakthrough:** Temporal spike encoding preserves conformal semantics in event-driven processing.

**Theorem 3 (Spike-Rate Coverage):** For spike-rate encoding of conformal scores with rate $r_i = \lambda \cdot p_i$, coverage probability satisfies:
$$P\left(\sum_{t} S_i(t) > \tau\right) \geq 1 - \alpha + O(1/\sqrt{T})$$

where $S_i(t)$ are spike events and $T$ is the integration window.

### 2.4 Hierarchical Conformal Calibration (HCC)

**Problem:** Standard conformal prediction requires large calibration sets (100+ samples).

**Breakthrough:** Multi-resolution calibration with theoretical guarantees using minimal data.

**Theorem 4 (Hierarchical Coverage):** For $L$-level hierarchical calibration with weights $w_l$ and $n_l$ samples per level:
$$P(Y \in C(X)) \geq 1 - \alpha + O\left(\sum_{l=1}^L \frac{w_l}{\sqrt{n_l}}\right)$$

## 3. Experimental Validation
