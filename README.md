# HyperConformal
HyperConformal brings calibrated uncertainty quantification to hyperdimensional computing (HDC). This is the first library combining HDC's ultra-efficient binary/complex vector operations with conformal prediction's statistical guaranteesâ€”perfect for ultra-low-power MCUs where traditional neural networks' softmax computations are too expensive.
