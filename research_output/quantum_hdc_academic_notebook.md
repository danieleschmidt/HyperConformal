## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) represents a brain-inspired computational paradigm that operates with high-dimensional vectors (typically 1,000-10,000 dimensions) to encode and manipulate symbolic information. Classical HDC has demonstrated remarkable robustness and efficiency in various machine learning tasks, but faces computational bottlenecks when scaling to very high dimensions or large datasets.

Quantum computing offers unique advantages through quantum superposition, entanglement, and measurement that can potentially overcome these classical limitations. However, previous work has not established formal quantum advantage proofs or integrated uncertainty quantification through conformal prediction.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Quantum Speedup Analysis

#### Theorem 1: Quantum HDC Similarity Speedup

**Statement**: Let H₁, H₂ ∈ {-1, +1}^d be hypervectors of dimension d, and let |ψ₁⟩, |ψ₂⟩ be their quantum encodings in ⌈log₂(d)⌉ qubits. If the hypervectors satisfy the sparse correlation condition |⟨H₁, H₂⟩| ≤ O(√d log d), then quantum similarity computation achieves:
- Classical complexity: O(d)
- Quantum complexity: O(log d)  
- Quantum speedup: Θ(d/log d)

**Proof Sketch**: 
1. Classical lower bound: Any classical algorithm must examine Ω(d) entries
2. Quantum encoding: Map H to |ψ_H⟩ = (1/√d) Σᵢ H[i]|i⟩ preserving inner products
3. Quantum algorithm: Use controlled-rotation with measurement in O(log d) time
4. Error analysis: Under sparse correlation, achieve ε-approximation with O(log(1/δ)/ε²) samples

**Quantum Advantage Validation**:
- d=1,000: 100.3x theoretical speedup
- d=10,000: 752.6x theoretical speedup
- d=100,000: 6,020x theoretical speedup

#### Theorem 2: Quantum Bundling Advantage

**Statement**: For k hypervectors {H₁, ..., Hₖ} in {-1, +1}^d, quantum bundling using superposition achieves:
- Classical complexity: O(kd)
- Quantum complexity: O(log k + log d)
- Quantum speedup: Θ(kd/(log k + log d))

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Classical bundling: B = (1/k) Σᵢ Hᵢ requires O(kd) operations
2. Quantum superposition: |Ψ⟩ = (1/√k) Σᵢ |i⟩|ψᵢ⟩ with QFT in O(log k + log d) time
3. Measurement gives bundled state with same approximation guarantees

### 2.2 Quantum Conformal Prediction Theory

#### Theorem 3: Coverage Guarantee with Quantum Uncertainty

**Statement**: For quantum conformal predictor Q(·) with measurement uncertainty σ² and significance level α:

P(Y_{n+1} ∈ Q(X_{n+1})) ≥ 1 - α - 2√(σ²log(2/δ)/n) - 1/n

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Classical guarantee: P(Y ∈ C(X)) ≥ 1 - α - 1/n
2. Quantum measurement model: S^q = S^{true} + ε where ε ~ N(0, σ²)
3. Error propagation: |τ^q - τ| ≤ √(σ²log(2/δ)/n) with probability ≥ 1-δ/2
4. Coverage analysis combines all error sources

### 2.3 Convergence Analysis

#### Theorem 4: Quantum Variational Convergence

**Statement**: For quantum conformal loss L(θ) that is β-smooth and μ-strongly convex:

E[L(θₜ) - L(θ*)] ≤ (1 - 2μη + β²η²)ᵗ [L(θ₀) - L(θ*)]

With optimal learning rate η = O(μ/β²), convergence is exponential: O(exp(-μt/β)).

### 2.4 Error Analysis for NISQ Devices

#### Theorem 5: Noise Robustness

**Statement**: For quantum device with error rate ε ≤ ε₀ = O(1/poly(d, depth)):

P(Y ∈ C^{noisy}(X)) ≥ 1 - α - O(√(ε·depth·log d)) - 1/n

The algorithm maintains quantum advantage for NISQ devices with ε ≈ 0.001-0.01.
